# Student Stress Factors: Bayesian Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project applies Bayesian statistical methods to analyze various factors contributing to student stress. It includes a detailed exploration of data involving student demographics, academic pressures, and personal lifestyle, using Bayesian models to infer the impact of these factors on stress levels.

## Features
- **Bayesian Statistical Modeling:** Utilizes advanced Bayesian methods to estimate the effects of multiple stress-related factors.
- **Data Visualization:** Features graphical representations of data and model outcomes to facilitate understanding of key insights.
- **Interactivity:** Includes interactive elements to manipulate model parameters and visualize different scenarios.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: `pymc3`, `arviz`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apoorva-Udupa/Student_stress_factors_BayesianModelling.git
cd student-stress-factors-bayesian
```
